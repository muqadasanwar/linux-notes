(-m means modules)
-m ping 	(Test we can logon)
-m shell
-m user		
-m file		(Change file ownership, group and permissions)
-m yum		( Installs, upgrade, downgrades, removes, and lists packages and groups with the `yum' package manager)
-m copy
-m service (present if available 
-m lineinfile 	(to add any line or contenct in a file)
-m lineinfile -a "path=/etc/test1 line=content create=yes" (to add any line or content in a file)
-m lineinfile -a "path=/etc/test1 regexp=content state=absent" (to remove content of a file)
-m command 	( The given command will be executed on all selected nodes.)
-m stat		(gives facts for a file)
-m dnf		( Installs, upgrade, removes, and lists packages and groups with the `dnf' package manager)

*idompontency* (performing the operation multiple times yields the same result as if it were executed only once)

*forks=5 	(to equally distribute information)(we can change the number after we vim the package)
